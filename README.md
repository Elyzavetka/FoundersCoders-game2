# Colour Wars Game

In this game, two players can take part. Each player has their colour (blue or pink). Players take turns placing their colours in empty squares. The first player who gets 4 cells of their colour in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins. If all 16 squares are filled and no one collects 4 cells of their colour in a row, the game ends in a tie.
