# FoundersCoders-game2

This game was made by Yelyzaveta Tarasova for applications to Founders&Coders Bootkamp.In this game can take a part two players. Every player has their color (blue or pink). Players take turns putting their colors in empty squares. The first player who get 4 cells of their color in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. If all 16 squares are full and nobody don't collect 4 cells their color in line the game ends in a tie.
